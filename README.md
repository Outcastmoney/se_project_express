# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Description

WTWR (What to Wear?) is a weather application that helps users decide on their outfit based on the current weather. This repository contains the back-end code for the WTWR application, providing API endpoints for user management and clothing item recommendations.

The application allows users to:
- Register and log in securely
- Create, view, and delete clothing items
- Like and unlike clothing items
- View recommended clothing items based on weather conditions
- Update their user profile information

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application
- **Express.js** - Web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing user and clothing item data
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - For secure user authentication and authorization
- **bcryptjs** - For password hashing and security
- **Middleware** - Custom middleware for authentication and request handling
- **RESTful API Design** - Following REST principles for API endpoint design
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
